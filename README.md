# **CoffeKing-Yelp-Academic-Dataset**

## Background
CoffeeKing, a startup coffee company, aims to offer a unique and inclusive experience. They seek insights from Yelp reviews and user data to inform location selection, operating hours, business enhancements, and loyalty-focused marketing strategies.

I'm choosing this project over the otherones because I'm highly intrigued by the potential insights I can found through an in-depth analysis of Yelp data. My extensive experience in the merchant cash advance industry has given me a deep appreciation for understanding the intricacies of how businesses operate.
